# Pokedex App-website! Project made for Allegro Summer Experience

I've made Pokedex with React + Styled-components. I've used React Hooks to manipulate state and fetch data from PokeAPI.
Project is database with all pokemons that exists.

As default view You can see list of pokemons, with 5 names on each page. That gives 807 pokemons avaiable on 162 pages.

There is functionality that allows user to filter list through the search results. After typing any character in input area, You will see scrollable list of all pokemons whose name contains the given string of characters.

You can visit and enjoy Pokedex at https://robertc481.github.io/pokedex
